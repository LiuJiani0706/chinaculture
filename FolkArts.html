                Chinese folk arts demonstrate their unique cultural value and deep historical traditions across multiple fields, particularly in food, festivals, and handicrafts. By comparing with Western culture, we can better understand the distinctive features of Chinese folk arts. <br>
                1. Food <br>
                In traditional Chinese festivals such as the Spring Festival or Mid-Autumn Festival, food is not only a treat for the taste buds but also a visual feast. For example, dumplings are shaped like ingots, symbolizing wealth, and mooncakes are adorned with patterns representing good fortune. Southern Chinese pastries, such as longevity peaches and rice cakes, also carry cultural meanings of longevity and good fortune. <br>
                Comparison with Western folk arts: In Western culture, food decoration is more related to modern baking and decorating techniques, such as frosting flowers on cakes or chocolate carvings. Western holiday foods like Christmas cookies or Easter eggs, while symbolic, tend to emphasize visual aesthetics over the cultural symbolism found in Chinese culinary arts. <br>
                2. Festivals <br>
                During festivals like the Spring Festival and Lantern Festival, hanging lanterns, putting up New Year paintings, and performing lion or dragon dances are common forms of folk art. These activities not only serve as decoration or entertainment but also carry cultural meanings of blessing, warding off evil, and family reunion. The making of lanterns for the Lantern Festival is a complex craft, with each lantern uniquely designed to showcase folk creativity. <br>
                Comparison with Western folk arts: Western festivals are often influenced by religion and historical events, focusing on social gatherings and decoration. Christmas, one of the most important Western holidays, includes traditions such as decorating Christmas trees, exchanging gifts, and lighting up homes, emphasizing family and friendship. Easter also holds significant religious meaning, symbolizing rebirth and hope. <br>
                3. Handicrafts <br>
                Chinese folk arts include paper cutting, embroidery, pottery, and straw weaving. Paper cutting is commonly used for holiday decorations and festive occasions, symbolizing good luck and prosperity, while embroidery is seen on clothing and bedding, serving both decorative and functional purposes. Pottery, such as Yixing teapots or Jingdezhen porcelain, combines artistry with practicality and is highly appreciated. <br>
                Comparison with Western folk arts: In Western culture, handicrafts often focus on decorative items and personal creations, such as knitting, wood carving, and pottery. Western crafts typically have an independent artistic value and are less integrated with daily life practicality. Although traditional Western crafts like Scottish textiles or Italian glasswork exist, they emphasize artistic individuality rather than practicality or cultural symbolism. <br>
                Conclusion <br>
                Chinese folk arts in food, festivals, and handicrafts reflect a close connection with daily life, combining aesthetic value with deep cultural significance. In contrast, Western folk arts tend to focus more on individual creativity and decoration, with less emphasis on everyday functionality. Through these comparisons, foreigners can gain a clearer understanding of the cultural heritage and aesthetic pursuits embedded in Chinese folk arts. <br>
