            推荐书目：<br>
            1. "The Great Wall: A Cultural History" by Carlos Rojas. The book, published by Harvard University Press, draws a new framework for understanding the function and meaning of the Great Wall by examining allusions to it in a variety of texts, from official dynastic history, elite poetry, and folk tales to contemporary visitors' assessments, children's songs, and avant-garde performance art, exploring the cultural history of the Great Wall and its true meaning and greatness. <br>
            
            2. "The Great Wall of China" by Leonard Everett Fisher: This is a children's picture book, published in 1995, but still valuable today. With vivid illustrations and easy-to-understand language, it introduces readers to the history, construction process, and importance of the Great Wall, which is suitable for families who bring their children to learn about the Great Wall. <br>
